# Phase 6F-4B — Plugin Center Development Report

Status: PHASE 6F-4B USER ACCEPTED / COMPLETE. The user accepted the R5 UI result in the subsequent Phase 6F-4C authorization. Earlier development, verification and pending-acceptance entries below are historical records.

Authority: `phase6f4-manager-platform-architecture.md` (APPROVED / COMPLETE) and the user's per-round Phase 6F-4B authorization. Development, automated results, packaged desktop observations, and pending user acceptance are labeled separately below. Phase 6F-4C / 4D, SDK Sync and Phase 6G remain NOT STARTED.

Current visual authority: the user's subsequent proportional-sizing and scrollbar request, preserving the accepted visual design and Round 4 navigation changes. Existing Settings internal typography is the normal-density reference. Shared responsive sizing replaces individual fixed component dimensions in the revised Manager surfaces. The Round 4 text specification and its screenshot-prerequisite correction remain applicable where unchanged. The sidebar contains Catalog-driven installed plugin children; Settings owns the entry to the existing Plugin Management overview. Search belongs to each page and the shell has a compact breadcrumb only. The accepted Website/Plugin grids and Plugin Detail remain intact. Earlier Round 2/Round 3 sections are historical records.

## Earlier product implementation (historical)

- Manager has one Plugins parent entry followed by Host Catalog-derived installed-plugin children, including represented disabled/unavailable entries. The parent opens the overview; a child selects Plugin Detail without invoking a Feature. The existing manual section-switching model remains, and the Shell retains the selected catalog identity when returning from a compatibility page or independent Feature.
- The installed-plugin overview shows name, short description, feature summary and restrained Host state. Author/version/source are secondary information in Detail. Built-in Translation is identified as bundled functionality in Information; local packages are not represented as verified publishers.
- Detail starts with Icon / Name / Description / Primary Action, then Features, Information, Permissions, Health, Configuration where relevant, secondary Management when needed, and collapsed Technical Information. No new Router, registry, health database or configuration store is introduced.
- Features display readable invocation surfaces, context source/type and bounded file restrictions. Action labels distinguish independent windows, one-time commands and existing compatibility pages. Main remains the execution authority, including when a displayed snapshot becomes stale.
- `PluginSummary` is extended only with safe Feature description/context/surface metadata and unsupported-capability presentation. Main derives metadata from its existing validated package Feature cache. The three surface labels describe existing production entry paths, not new Manifest fields or grants. No entry document/module paths, raw Manifest or authority objects are returned.
- Requested/granted permissions retain the existing Host confirmation/revocation flow. Unsupported implementation is described separately from grant state. Saving permissions does not make an unimplemented capability available.
- Current Host status and the last invocation failure are presented separately. Product errors use code-based bounded copy and recovery guidance. Raw errors/stacks remain in the existing developer diagnostics panel, now mounted only after the user expands Developer Tools.
- Local install/reimport/replace/uninstall still call existing preload APIs. Host package validation, install consent, default-disabled installation and separate uninstall/delete-data confirmation are unchanged.

## Configuration boundary

No v3 config schema, SDK config API, capability bridge or Manager configuration management API was implemented.

- Existing v1 configuration remains in the compatibility page, through its existing active/enabled and permission gates. The Configuration entry explains that limitation; it does not claim disabled-plugin editing is already available and does not start a runtime merely to inspect configuration.
- v3 Detail honestly states that no usable configuration UI is currently available.
- Built-in Translation links to existing Settings. Translation-specific settings, global AI settings, persistence, credentials and translation behavior are not moved or changed.

Phase 6F-4D still owns completing the separate Manager management and Runtime configuration authority paths. This is the explicit 4B/4D boundary approved in this task, not a change to the frozen architecture.

## WebRuntimeView call-site finding

Static tracing found:

1. `App.vue` still imports/renders `WebRuntimeView` for `web-runtime`, listens to `desktop.webRuntime.onState`, and restores the previous section on close/absence.
2. `WebRuntimeView.vue` still measures its element, publishes bounds, observes resize and requests runtime close on unmount.
3. `electron/preload.ts` retains state subscription/removal, bounds and close IPC.
4. `electron/main.ts` still constructs the Manager-associated runtime, subscribes to status and registers Manager-frame-guarded bounds/close handlers.
5. The current non-test `openAuthority` caller is `PluginWindowManager`; Catalog production activation uses `FeatureActivationService` / `FeaturePresentationRouter`. Window Features go to independent Plugin Windows; Commands go to `NodeCommandExecutionAdapter` and temporary `utilityProcess.fork`.

These facts do not establish that every compatibility/development/history use of the Manager-associated runtime can be removed. `WebRuntimeView`, its IPC and runtime ownership remain unchanged in this round.

## Temporary Copy Diagnostics cleanup

The former Native reference chain was:

`SuperPanelWindow.xaml DiagnosticFooterRoot / Copy Diagnostics`
→ `CopyDiagnostics_Click`
→ `DiagnosticsService.GetSelectionDiagnosticTrace`
→ bounded plain-text formatter
→ system Clipboard.

The same temporary footer subscribed to `SelectionDiagnosticAttempt.Updated`, retained the current attempt, formatted its footer state, and participated in layout measurement.

Removed:

- Temporary diagnostic footer and Copy Diagnostics control.
- Dedicated click handler and diagnostic clipboard write.
- Footer-only observer subscription, current-attempt field and formatting/refresh handlers.
- Copy-only `GetSelectionDiagnosticTrace` formatter.
- The window's dedicated DiagnosticsService constructor dependency, including its single App call site.
- The removed footer's entry in layout measurement; normal panel geometry formulas and product surfaces remain intact.

Retained:

- DiagnosticsService event collection, bounded selection logs and CSV export.
- SelectionDiagnosticAttempt and capture/presentation tracking contracts, including the internal diagnostic state snapshot; capture code still uses this infrastructure.
- Preview metadata gates that control shared selection logging, not only clipboard copying.
- Manager PluginDevelopmentPanel / plugin runtime diagnostics and its independent Copy Diagnostics function.
- SelectionCaptureService, TextSelectionProvider, DesktopSelectionProvider, Explorer capture, input triggers, Press/Hold, context classification/matching, feature invocation and normal clipboard capabilities.

Selection Capture behavior was not changed. No capture source file was edited.

## Static source review

| Requirement | Source-review conclusion |
| --- | --- |
| Host-owned management and lifecycle | Existing Catalog/PluginManager/preload operations reused. |
| No second plugin/health registry | Only presentation helpers and transient UI state added. |
| Enabled != Resident | Explicit product copy; Main availability remains authoritative. |
| Window/Command execution | Existing independent PluginWindowManager / temporary Utility Process routing retained. |
| v1 compatibility | Existing DeclarativePluginView, getPages and invoke path retained. |
| WebRuntimeView preservation | Component/IPC unchanged; Shell runtime subscriber retained. |
| Translation / Shared AI | No business implementation changed. |
| Launcher ranking | No ranking/search source edited. |
| Super Panel selection | Capture/trigger/context/matching unchanged; only temporary diagnostic UI removed. |
| Shared diagnostics | Native logging and developer runtime diagnostics retained. |
| Config/data persistence | No schema, namespace, package format or migration changed. |
| Marketplace/update | No feed, download, fake update state or publisher verification added. |
| v3 config boundary | No new schema/bridge/fake editor. |
| MCP/Agent/Tool Registry | No implementation added. |

Architecture deviations: NONE. Static review does not certify compilation, visual appearance, runtime behavior or regressions. Those require separately authorized verification.

## Earlier Phase 6F-4B production changes (historical scope)

The following list records the earlier implementation scope, not files edited in UX Revision Round 2. The current round's exact file list is recorded below.

- `src/App.vue`
- `src/features/plugins/PluginManagerView.vue`
- `src/features/plugins/catalog-view-model.ts`
- `src/features/plugins/plugin-view-model.ts`
- `src/shared/plugin-contracts.ts`
- `electron/plugins/plugin-manager.ts`
- `native/WebTools.NativeHost/SuperPanel/SuperPanelWindow.xaml`
- `native/WebTools.NativeHost/SuperPanel/SuperPanelWindow.xaml.cs`
- `native/WebTools.NativeHost/Services/DiagnosticsService.cs`
- `native/WebTools.NativeHost/App.xaml.cs` (only remove the diagnostic-only window constructor argument)

The approved architecture baseline and Phase 6F-3 history are unchanged. Pre-existing dirty work remains in the current checkout.

## Earlier development verification boundary and next step (historical)

TESTING NOT RUN — USER HAS NOT AUTHORIZED TESTING

PACKAGING NOT RUN — USER HAS NOT AUTHORIZED PACKAGING

Typecheck, lint verification, build and runtime smoke were not run. Application and installer were not launched. Manual UX acceptance was not performed. No test, fixture, verification runner or evidence baseline was added or modified. No Git staging, commit or push was performed.

Phase 6F-4B development complete → user source review → separate testing/build authorization. Stop here; do not start Phase 6F-4C.

## Plugin Center UX implementation — Round 2 (historical)

- The Plugins parent opens the installed-plugin overview; catalog-derived child entries remain visible in the Manager sidebar, including disabled or unavailable installed plugins. Selecting a child shows its Plugin Detail and does not invoke a Feature.
- Plugin Detail now leads with identity, short description and the next supported action. Status, version, source and technical data appear lower in the page; management operations are shown only when the Host DTO supports them.
- Enabled Window Features use Open; primary Command Features use Run. Open/Run receives a split menu only when real Host-supported management actions exist. Disabled plugins use a standalone Enable button, permission-blocked plugins use Review Permissions, and fault/invalid/incompatible states expose only supported status/retry/recovery actions. Non-runnable states do not acquire an arrow for visual consistency; remaining supported management actions appear lower in Detail.
- Plugin management is consistent; plugin working experiences remain Feature-owned.
- Action first, metadata later.
- Selecting an installed plugin in the Manager selects its Host-owned Plugin Detail. Invoking its primary Feature is a separate action.
- Installed-plugin navigation is derived from the Host catalog and does not create per-plugin Manager modules or a second registry.

### Production files edited in Round 2

- `src/App.vue`: restrained selected-child treatment, explicit parent/child hierarchy, bounded label layout and a generic Plugin Center topbar label in Detail instead of repeating the selected plugin name above its header.
- `src/features/plugins/PluginManagerView.vue`: state-appropriate primary action presentation, unified enabled split control, controlled management-menu interaction, secondary management placement, non-duplicated single-Feature actions, readable compact sections and theme-aware visual refinements.
- `docs/phase6f4b-plugin-center-development.md`: reconciled the original navigation/current-state wording and recorded this round's source scope and verification boundary.

`catalog-view-model.ts` was inspected and reused without edits in Round 2. Its existing Host Catalog navigation and Window/Command presentation mapping already support this design. No other production file was edited in this round.

### Interaction and visual implementation

- Open/Run and the arrow share a 36px outer control, one border/radius, zero gap and an internal divider. The 34px inner segments have matching hover/active colors and independent visible keyboard focus. Both segments disable during loading/management operations.
- The menu is absolutely positioned below the control, so opening it does not move page content. It uses truthful capability-derived actions, a separator before Uninstall, restrained destructive color and a short data-retention note.
- Opening the menu focuses its first item; Arrow Up on the trigger opens at the last item. Arrow keys, Home and End navigate items. Escape closes and restores trigger focus. Outside pointer input, focus leaving the action control, window blur, Host action changes and management busy state dismiss it. Focus moving between menu and trigger stays within the same control so a trigger click can close it reliably. Component mount/unmount owns and removes the document/window listeners. These are source-level implementation facts, not runtime acceptance results.
- Disabled/permission/error states retain one useful primary button. Supported replace/uninstall or recovery operations remain reachable in the secondary Management section. Built-in Translation never receives unsupported replace/uninstall actions.
- Review Permissions / View Status moves keyboard focus to the relevant section heading as well as scrolling it into view; reduced-motion preference uses immediate scrolling.
- Single-Feature Detail has one top-level launch action. Multi-Feature Detail identifies which available Feature the top action uses and provides quieter individual buttons for the other Features.
- Content is bounded to 920px with 30px/32px desktop padding; smaller widths reduce padding. The header uses a 46px icon column, a flexible identity column and the action column. Narrow layout puts the action below the identity instead of relying on a fixed left margin.
- Sidebar children use a visible hierarchy rail, 34px rows, ellipsis with a full-name title, a subtle selected background/edge and keyboard focus. Sidebar width is unchanged.
- Typography keeps the existing Windows UI font stack, a 22px plugin title, 12px header description and compact section labels/body text. Sections use spacing and rules rather than nested cards. Theme tokens control surfaces, hover, selection and focus; warning/destructive text receives separate light/dark colors. Technical Information remains collapsed by default.

### Skills and scope

`superpowers:brainstorming` was used to carry the already approved bounded UX brief into implementation without reopening architecture. `frontend-design` was applied to the desktop typography scale, restrained hierarchy, action geometry, spacing, theme states and removal of redundant context/actions. No new design or architecture approval is claimed.

Plugin management is consistent; plugin working experiences remain Feature-owned. This round does not change Plugin Host authority, Feature activation/presentation routing, runtime ownership, Legacy Translation behavior, configuration contracts, Super Panel, Shared AI or the approved Phase 6F-4A architecture. No temporary Translation window was created. Phase 6F-4C was not started.

### Round 2 verification boundary

Static source and scoped diff review only. No tests, test files, fixtures, verification runners, evidence scripts or hash baselines were changed. No typecheck, lint, build, runtime smoke or manual acceptance was run; application/dev server/installer were not launched. No staging, commit or push was performed. This source revision does not inherit a Preview or manual PASS from earlier source/builds.

TESTING NOT RUN — USER HAS NOT AUTHORIZED TESTING

PACKAGING NOT RUN — USER HAS NOT AUTHORIZED PACKAGING

Phase 6F-4B UX Revision implementation complete → awaiting user review → verification / Preview requires separate authorization.

## UX Revision Round 3 — Manager Shell / Websites / Plugin Overview

### Visual reference and source scope

The attached image was inspected before production edits. This is implementation of its desktop layout using real product data, not a new architecture or alternative dashboard design. The reference controls navigation proportions, alignment, page hierarchy and the grid language. Earlier Round 2 verification/Preview results do not certify this new source revision.

Production source files edited in this round only:

- `src/App.vue`: navigation group/destination, shared topbar, grid-page search binding and real website-count presentation.
- `src/features/favorites/FavoritesView.vue`: website header, category filtering, responsive cards, existing layout-setting integration and preservation of editing/classification paths.
- `src/features/plugins/PluginManagerView.vue`: wide installed-plugin overview, truthful Catalog cards and overview search. Detail markup, action logic and Detail-specific styles were not redesigned.
- `src/styles/tokens.css`: theme-aware Manager shell and shared grid-page/card/toolbar styles.
- `src/features/plugins/catalog-view-model.ts`: only rename user-facing Manager surface labels from `插件中心` to `插件管理`.
- `src/features/plugins/plugin-view-model.ts`: only rename the session-expired recovery destination to `插件管理`.

Documentation edited: this report. These files may also contain earlier uncommitted work; their complete Git diff against HEAD is not a Round 3-only diff.

### Manager shell and navigation

- Reference-like sidebar width uses `clamp(220px, 19vw, 380px)`, with a 200px narrow-window variant. Identity is at the top, followed by `工作区` and `网址`.
- `插件` is a lightweight collapsible group heading rather than a selected destination button. Installed children and `插件管理` share the same icon/text columns, row geometry and padding; the old indentation/rail is removed.
- Installed navigation still comes exclusively from `catalogInstalledNavigationItems`, including disabled/unavailable entries. A child calls `selectPluginDetail`; Plugin Management calls the existing overview navigation. Neither child selection nor overview-card selection invokes a Feature.
- The navigation region scrolls independently when necessary; Settings and the existing local-space identity remain anchored beneath it.
- The topbar has breadcrumb/context, a real search input on Websites/Plugin Management, the existing help affordance and the existing local-space initial. No account service or unsupported keyboard shortcut was added.
- Desktop content guides use 14px page margins plus 30px page padding, aligned with the topbar's 44px inset. Smaller layouts reduce both guides together. Grid pages use the wide available content area; Detail retains its existing 920px bound.

### Websites

- The header reproduces the reference's website icon, title/description and right-side Edit / New Folder / Add Website controls.
- Horizontal category chips use the existing BookmarkFolder data and real membership counts, plus All and Unclassified. New Category opens the existing folder dialog; it is not a new category persistence model.
- Normal All view deduplicates actual websites into one grid. Specific categories use the existing folder membership. Edit mode retains collection sections and collapse/rename/delete controls so persisted reorder and unclassified-to-folder drag remain available. Folder tabs also accept the existing classification drop action.
- Cards show the actual favicon (or the existing fallback), title, hostname, optional description and actual folder names. Folder chips are bounded to two plus a truthful remainder count. No mock websites, synthetic descriptions or invented tags/counts were added.
- Existing browser-open, editor, delete confirmation, folder dialogs and persistence APIs remain wired. Right-side browser-open and native disclosure menus provide compact actions. Selecting a category before Add Website supplies that existing folder to the editor.
- Grid/List uses the existing `websiteLayout` setting through existing get/update Settings APIs. Sorting by manual order, actual creation time or name is a view-only selector, not a new persistent ordering schema. Edit mode uses manual order; filtered reorder submits the full underlying collection so hidden websites are retained.
- Topbar search filters existing name, URL, description and folder names. Search state stays in the Manager shell across page navigation.

### Related grid language / Detail preservation

- Websites and Plugin Management share the same responsive `manager-grid`, 16px gap, 11px card radius, subtle theme border, 44px icon box and title/description/metadata rhythm. Cards have a 132px minimum height with no scale/elevation animation.
- The grid targets approximately three columns when enough desktop content width is available, reduces automatically below its 270px item minimum, and uses one column for the explicit website list view. Sparse plugin lists retain compact column width instead of stretching a single plugin into a full-page card.
- Plugin cards use existing Catalog name, safe icon, description, Feature summary and Host status. Their trailing chevron indicates Detail navigation, not invocation. Install continues through the existing local installer/consent path.
- Plugin Detail's Icon / Name / Description / Primary Action, Open / Run / Enable handling, split menu, Features, Information, Permissions, Health, Configuration, secondary Management and collapsed Technical Information remain intact. Only shell context/terminology changes around it.
- New Manager layout colors are theme tokens with light/dark values. The light layout follows the supplied soft neutral/blue reference; dark keeps the same structure and theme-aware surfaces/focus states. This is a source implementation statement, not an observed rendering PASS.

### Static review and exclusions

Static reading confirmed the navigation/card handlers select Detail rather than execute Features; website actions continue using existing IPC APIs; grids are not constrained to Detail width; and only management-facing copy changed in the two view-model helpers. No test, fixture, runner, evidence or hash baseline was edited.

No Plugin Host/Catalog authority, Feature activation/presentation routing, PluginWindowManager, FeatureRef, projection, Node Command, configuration contract, Shared AI, SecretStore, Super Panel, Launcher ranking, NativeHost, Electron Main/preload, installer or data schema was changed. Legacy Translation still uses its existing compatibility page.

Reference-only features not added: mock tag/analytics/visit data, fake cloud/account state, Marketplace, new Favorites subsystem, new sorting persistence, or the screenshot's macOS window controls and unimplemented command-key shortcut. Existing folders/counts were reused because they are real current capabilities.

Skills: `superpowers:using-superpowers` and `superpowers:brainstorming` carried the user's already-specified implementation brief and scope; `frontend-design` guided alignment, shared card geometry, typography, focus and theme treatment. The supplied reference overrides creative reinterpretation. No new design approval is required by this already-authorized implementation round.

### Round 3 verification boundary / next step

Static source and scoped diff review only. Tests, typecheck, lint, build, package/Preview, runtime smoke and manual acceptance were not run. Application, dev server and installer were not launched. No staging, commit, push or other Git mutation was performed. Existing dirty work remains preserved.

TESTING NOT RUN — USER HAS NOT AUTHORIZED TESTING

PACKAGING NOT RUN — USER HAS NOT AUTHORIZED PACKAGING

Phase 6F-4B UX Revision Round 3 development complete → awaiting user review → verification / new Preview requires separate authorization. Phase 6F-4C remains NOT STARTED.

## UX Revision Round 3 — Verification and Preview (separate authorization)

The user separately authorized tests, build, runtime visual inspection, and a new Preview. Verification was run against branch `codex/shared-ai-translation-2.0`, HEAD `707c5673dff479285b34a5b441bec9d3b725c737`, with a dirty worktree containing unrelated ongoing Phase 6E/6F work. Environment: Windows 10.0.26100, Node `v24.21.0`, pnpm `9.15.9`, .NET SDK `10.0.401`.

### Automated verification

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | PASS; lockfile already current |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | FAIL outside Round 3: `electron/plugins/node-command-execution.ts(112,57)`, `unknown` is not assignable to `string` |
| Focused Plugin Center / Websites tests (23) | 17 PASS / 6 FAIL; the same stale UI/view-model expectations were present in the previous Round 2 verification. No test was changed. |
| `pnpm test` | 486 PASS / 21 FAIL out of 507. Round 3-related failures are the same six previously recorded stale UI/view-model expectations (B). Fourteen other failures are in separate Plugin Runtime, IPC/Feature contract, or installer work already dirty outside Round 3 (C). The SDK `dev-v3` watcher test also fails in isolation with `UNSAFE_DEPENDENCY_LINK @webtools/plugin-sdk` followed by `Node preload change was not rebuilt` (D, unrelated SDK test fixture/runtime). No Round 3-specific failing test was identified. |
| `pnpm run build` | PASS; Electron Main, Preload, Renderer, and sandbox preload built |
| NativeHost Checks | 70/72; two unrelated existing assertions fail: invocation source `super-panel` is now accepted, and the old per-plugin 16-Feature cap assertion no longer matches current code |
| UpdateHelper Checks | PASS, 10/10 |
| `pnpm run lint` | NO LINT SCRIPT AVAILABLE |
| `git diff --check` | PASS for tracked changes; Git emitted line-ending conversion warnings only. The untracked report was separately checked for trailing whitespace: 0 lines. |

NativeHost build output included unresolved-reference warnings for `UIAutomationClient` and `UIAutomationTypes`; publish/package completed successfully and included the staged runtime files.

### Actual rendered UI and functional smoke

The requested visual runtime check could not be performed in this desktop session. The computer-use surface reported no controllable native applications (`apps: []`). A Round 2 NativeHost remained running at PID 11388 from `release/native-preview-20261011-214038/.../WebTools.NativeHost.exe`; it uses the shared `Local\WebTools.NativeHost` mutex and default `%APPDATA%\Nook` profile. It was left untouched. Launching Round 3 through the normal entry point would therefore risk reaching the Round 2 instance or the real profile. No app was launched, no installation smoke was run, and no user profile, startup registration, or Favorites were changed.

Accordingly, these are **NOT VERIFIED at runtime**: Manager Shell visual hierarchy; Websites first viewport; Plugin Management visuals and card-to-Detail behavior; Plugin Detail regression; Light and Dark themes; responsive resizing; search/category/layout/sort/open/dialog/edit smoke. The source build passed, but it is not visual evidence. User manual acceptance remains required.

### New Preview artifact evidence

- Preview identity: `WebTools-Phase6F4B-UX-R3-Preview`; UX revision: `phase6f4b-ux-r3`.
- Canonical stage: `release/native-preview-20261011-224338/stage/application` (550 files).
- Git identity embedded in `preview-build.json`: `707c5673dff479285b34a5b441bec9d3b725c737`; dirty: `true`.
- ZIP: `release/native-preview-20261011-224338/WebTools-Phase6F4B-UX-R3-Preview.zip`; 237,628,183 bytes; SHA-256 `D180649D7779985C21330869517E328625847739DDEC9B22938D662CBEDE58F0`.
- Installer: `release/native-preview-20261011-224338/WebTools-Phase6F4B-UX-R3-Preview-Setup-0.1.0.exe`; 191,676,943 bytes; SHA-256 `64F83FE93E54F754FD18F37058189358828C04A0013632BCBFEB36808E06FC44`.
- ZIP ↔ canonical stage: PASS; 550 entries, zero missing, mismatched, or extra files.
- Packaging used `scripts/build-native-production.ps1 -PreviewOnly -PreviewName WebTools-Phase6F4B-UX-R3-Preview -PreviewUxRevision phase6f4b-ux-r3`. Preview-only mode did not install or launch the application.

### Verification change boundary and phase status

Verification changed no production code, tests, or package lockfile. The already-untracked development report was updated with this verification record. Generated/ignored outputs are under `out/`, native `bin/obj/`, and the new `release/native-preview-20261011-224338/` directory; the test log is in the system TEMP directory. Git status contains 227 entries: 0 staged, 164 unstaged tracked changes, and 63 untracked paths. The pre-existing dirty changes remain unstaged and uncommitted; no commit or push was made.

Result: **PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS — READY FOR USER MANUAL ACCEPTANCE**. This means the Round 3 source built and a consistent Preview was produced; it does not mean rendered UI or runtime smoke passed. Phase 6F-4B remains awaiting **USER MANUAL ACCEPTANCE**. Phase 6F-4C remains **NOT STARTED**.

## UX Revision Round 4 — UI Proportion / Navigation Cleanup

The user authorized implementation, existing verification, build, runtime smoke, and a new Preview in one task. The subsequent correction explicitly removed all screenshot prerequisites; Round 4 follows the written specification. It preserves earlier dirty work and the accepted grids/Detail.

### Production source modified in Round 4

- `src/App.vue`: removed shell search state and the entire right-side search/help/avatar markup, removed the Plugin Management navigation item, connected the Settings event to existing `showPluginCenter`, and retained Catalog-derived plugin children. Plugin Management context reads `设置 / 插件管理`; Settings stays selected on the overview. The existing section/state model is reused.
- `src/features/favorites/FavoritesView.vue`: owns its search ref/input inside the existing view/sort toolbar; filtering, no-match/add state, categories, dialogs, sorting and drag handlers use the same existing data/actions.
- `src/features/plugins/PluginManagerView.vue`: owns overview search beside its installed heading/count. Cards still select Detail and do not invoke Features. Detail template, primary action and management logic were not redesigned.
- `src/features/settings/SettingsView.vue`: adds one existing-style group and `管理插件` button; the typed event opens the one existing Plugin Management overview. No grid duplication or new window/router was introduced.
- `src/styles/tokens.css`: adjusts role-specific icon bounds, sidebar spacing and page-local controls. No global transform, text scaling or persistence schema change.

| Role | Round 3 implementation | Round 4 implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sidebar identity | 44px box / 30px mark | 44px box / 28px mark; no empty enlarged slot |
| Primary / Settings icon | 20px width | explicit 20x20px |
| Plugin child icon | 20px | explicit 18x18px |
| Navigation row | 48px height / 16px gap | 42px height / 12px gap; text sizes preserved |
| Page identity | 56px box / 28px glyph | 44px box / 22px glyph |
| Website/overview icon | 44px box; PNG overview 34px | 40px box; PNG overview 32px; website image/fallback 40px |
| Open/overflow glyph | 16–17px attributes | explicit 16px role bounds |
| Shell top context | 72px plus right controls | 44px, breadcrumb only; right-control markup/allocation removed |

Sidebar width is now `clamp(220px, 17vw, 280px)` rather than a 380px maximum. Website/Plugin cards retain their 132px minimum and responsive grid. Search fields use a bounded 280px page-local toolbar slot, with wrapping at smaller widths. The bottom local-space identity remains; only the top-right identity was removed.

### Verification commands/results

Source/build identity: `codex/shared-ai-translation-2.0`, HEAD `707c5673dff479285b34a5b441bec9d3b725c737`, dirty worktree. Node `v24.21.0`, pnpm `9.15.9`, .NET SDK `10.0.401`, Windows build `10.0.26100`.

| Verification | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | PASS, no lockfile change |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Vue check completed; combined command FAIL at existing Node Command `node-command-execution.ts(112,57)`, TS2345 |
| Existing focused UI/view-model/Favorites tests | 17/23 PASS, 6 previously recorded stale expectations |
| `pnpm test` | 486/507 PASS, 21 FAIL; failure-name set exactly matches the saved Round 3 log |
| `pnpm run build` | PASS, Main/Preload/Renderer/sandbox preload |
| NativeHost Checks | 70/72, the same old invocation-source and per-plugin cap assertions |
| UpdateHelper Checks | 10/10 PASS |
| Lint | NO LINT SCRIPT AVAILABLE |
| `git diff --check` | PASS; untracked report checked separately for whitespace |

Logs are outside the repository: `%TEMP%/webtools-r4-{typecheck,focused,full,build,native,updater}.log`. No test was rewritten or added to make the suite green.

### Failure classification (every full-suite failure)

No confirmed Round 4 regression (A) or unresolved unknown (E) was found. Current failures match the previous failure-name set. The following classification uses current error messages; the four strip-only TypeScript loader failures are explicitly classed as D here rather than inheriting the broader Round 3 C label.

| Category | Failing full-suite test |
| --- | --- |
| B — stale UI/view-model expectation | Manager center manages the bundled Translation state separately from package operations |
| B | rendered network permission is disabled and unchecked while approved storage permission stays selectable |
| B | plugin center includes explicit empty, loading, error and retry states |
| B | plugin center exposes install, enable/disable, grants, details and uninstall through the typed host API |
| B | Manifest v3 Web Features can be opened from the Plugin Center |
| B | permission display exposes requested, granted and missing capability state without implying trust |
| C — pre-existing/unrelated | PluginManager publishes Feature authority changes only after successful mutations |
| C | undelivered context expires at thirty seconds and revokes its Host-owned lifetime |

The four loader errors report `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_TYPESCRIPT_SYNTAX` for parameter properties. The SDK test reports `UNSAFE_DEPENDENCY_LINK @webtools/plugin-sdk` before its preload rebuild timeout. Additionally, typecheck's existing TS2345 is C, and NativeHost Checks' two old assertions (`super-panel` source rejection and 17-Feature rejection) are C. These separate backend/SDK/test issues were recorded without changing their implementation.

### Actual packaged Windows desktop smoke

The `computer-use` Skill's native `@oai/sky` interface was available in this round. Actual production NativeHost and packaged `Manager/WebTools.exe` were run from the R4 stage using existing isolation mechanisms, not mocked Renderer output.

- NativeHost PID 3080; Manager Main PID 20476; window ID 1968458. Executable paths and process creation times were inspected. GPU/Utility/Renderer command lines used the disposable profile `C:/Users/Example/AppData/Local/Temp/webtools-round4-SZOtdr`.
- Native resource control pipe: `WebTools.NativeHost.Resource.3c80376151d9475eb060f041aa225c88`; the existing test mode supplied a distinct Manager pipe/mutex and isolated `Control+Alt+Shift+F12` registration. It omits startup registration, Tray and Super Panel configuration.
- The disposable profile contained six ordinary public HTTPS website records, one test folder, default AI settings and no credentials. Real `%APPDATA%/Nook`, installed application data and startup settings were not used as the test profile or changed through UI.

Observed results:

| Runtime operation/visual | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| Shell proportions / right region | Normal-sized identity/navigation/page glyphs; breadcrumb is compact; no global search/help/top-right avatar or reserved wide control group |
| Sidebar | Only the actual bundled Translation Catalog entry under Plugins; no Plugin Management destination there |
| Website search | `Vue` returns one website; clearing restores six |
| Category / layout | Developer-document folder returns three websites; Grid/List switch works |
| Existing dialog / edit | Add Website opens and cancels; edit mode enters/exits and retains folder controls |
| Settings entry | `管理插件` opens the existing overview within the same Manager window |
| Plugin search | Unmatched text shows zero; clearing restores the one Catalog plugin |
| Plugin card / Detail | Card opens accepted Detail with Open/split action, Features, Information, Permissions, Health, Configuration and Technical Information; no Feature was invoked |
| Themes | Websites, overview and Detail inspected in Light and Dark; new surfaces/text/focus treatment remained coherent |
| Responsive desktop | Captured 1029x715 default and 1500x952 maximized windows; grid changed from two to three columns with no horizontal overflow |
| Normal Manager close | Alt+F4 normal close; exact Manager executable process count became 0, while NativeHost remained |
| Final exit | Control-pipe normal NativeHost exit; exact stage process count became 0; no force termination |

Limits: these records used favicon fallbacks; image-backed website and third-party plugin icons were not independently exercised. Exact sorting/drag persistence and Translation/API execution were not retested by desktop input in this UI cleanup. The existing isolated mode's Super Panel Settings unavailable message is expected because that mode omits its configuration; no production Super Panel defect is inferred. User visual acceptance remains open.

Eight actual JPEG screenshots and machine-readable observations are in `C:/Users/Example/AppData/Local/Temp/webtools-round4-SZOtdr/evidence/`. Evidence JSON: `round4-runtime-smoke.json`, SHA-256 `5F733332F7A4CAADC88B2FDD2884C51EDB54C110456438BB2C3C961151C206B3`. Screenshot dimensions/hashes are recorded there. Images preserve the returned JPEG bytes; no redraw or image editing was performed.

### Preview and packaging recovery

Canonical command: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-native-production.ps1 -PreviewOnly -PreviewName WebTools-Phase6F4B-UX-R4-Preview -PreviewUxRevision phase6f4b-ux-r4`.

The first ZIP step failed because runtime smoke was started before archival completed and Manager held `chrome_100_percent.pak` open. The NSIS installer had completed. This was a verification/packaging sequencing error, not a production UI fix. After normal Manager and NativeHost exit and exact stage-process count 0, the missing ZIP was generated using the same `Compress-Archive -Path stage/application/* -CompressionLevel Optimal` step against the unchanged canonical stage. No older Preview was overwritten and no product source was changed after packaging began.

| Artifact | Evidence |

| Installer provenance | Generated NSIS input uses `File /r "stage\application\*.*"` and that stage's icon. Independent installer extraction/install-byte comparison was not performed. |

Artifact verification JSON is `%TEMP%/webtools-round4-artifact-evidence.json`. Preview-only packaging did not install the application.

### Verification edits, Git and final status

Verification changed no product or test code after the five-file implementation. A remaining old `props.searchQuery` empty-state reference was caught during pre-build static inspection and updated to the page-local ref before regression began. This document was updated; generated build/Preview files are ignored and profiles/logs/screenshots/evidence remain outside Git. The existing dirty worktree is preserved; no staging, commit, push or other prohibited Git operation occurred.

**PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS — NEW PREVIEW READY FOR USER MANUAL ACCEPTANCE**. Existing unrelated regression failures and the bounded icon/test-mode limitations are recorded above; actual Round 4 desktop smoke and final artifact consistency succeeded. Phase 6F-4B remains awaiting **USER MANUAL ACCEPTANCE**. Phase 6F-4C remains **NOT STARTED**.

## UX Revision Round 5 — Shared Density / Unified Scroll

This follow-up remains Phase 6F-4B. The user requested proportional reduction of the oversized revised UI, consistent page proportions, a thin scrollbar at the content's far-right edge, and preservation of the accepted style. The inherited verification/build/Preview authorization was used. R5 identifies this new Preview; it does not open another phase.

### Production changes and boundary

Only three production files were edited in this follow-up:

- `src/styles/tokens.css`: adds a bounded responsive `--manager-unit: clamp(.8rem, calc(.75rem + .08vw), .875rem)` and shared ratios for Manager typography, icons, navigation, controls, spacing, radii and card geometry. The existing Settings internal typography remains the normal-size reference. Borders and focus outlines retain their accessible treatment. No transform scaling, Electron zoom or OS display setting is used. Grid uses `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(100%, var(--manager-card-min-width)), 1fr))`; available width determines column count. Body no longer creates an outer scrollbar at short window heights.
- `src/App.vue`: adds one shared `.manager-content` scroll owner for ordinary Manager pages and resets its transient scroll position after page/Catalog selection changes. The fixed sidebar and topbar remain outside it. Reading-width pages no longer own a scrollbar inside their narrower layout. `WebRuntimeView` remains directly under the existing main panel, outside the new wrapper; its production bounds/IPC/ownership were not modified.
- `src/features/plugins/PluginManagerView.vue`: overview and Detail icon/text dimensions use the same shared tokens. The accepted Detail hierarchy and actions are preserved.

`FavoritesView.vue` and `SettingsView.vue` had earlier Round 4 edits but were not edited in R5. No NativeHost, runtime authority, Translation/AI implementation, credential handling, business persistence, dependency, schema, installer configuration or test implementation was changed in R5. Existing unrelated dirty work remains preserved.

### Actual packaged desktop observations

The completed canonical stage was copied to a disposable runtime directory before launch. All 550 files matched stage SHA-256 before and after smoke. Actual Release NativeHost and packaged `Manager/WebTools.exe` ran there, using the existing isolated resource-test mode, separate profile/mutex/pipe and `Control+Alt+Shift+F12` test binding. NativeHost PID was 21864; Manager Main PID was 23404; the same Manager window (1050456) was reused for page checks.

Runtime root: `C:/Users/Example/AppData/Local/Temp/webtools-round5-KLt2wO/runtime`. The sibling disposable profile contained 24 public HTTPS website records, one test folder and empty AI credentials. It did not use the production profile as test data. Existing isolated mode omits startup registration, Tray and Super Panel configuration. The resulting unavailable Super Panel Settings message is expected. A process-scoped test debug port supplied read-only Renderer geometry; no production configuration or DOM input mutation was performed through it.

| CSS viewport width | Website grid columns | Card minimum actual height | Card title font | Shared page title | Scrollbar width |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 841 | 2 | 105.59px | 11.20px | 22.40px | 5.12px |
| 1027 | 3 | 105.77px | 11.22px | 22.44px | 5.13px |
| 1500 | 5 | 108.90px | 11.55px | 23.10px | 5.28px |

These are observed output dimensions, not additional fixed CSS dimensions. Existing Settings group labels remained 11px, close to the revised Website title's 11.2px normal-width size. The shared scroll owner's right edge equaled the viewport width in all three layouts. Page overflow was `visible`; no horizontal overflow was observed. Settings scrolled to 487.5px while sidebar/topbar geometry remained fixed; switching back to Websites reset scrollTop to 0.

Light and Dark Websites, Settings, Plugin overview and Detail were inspected. Website search for Vue returned one result, clearing restored 24. Settings still opened the existing Plugin Management overview; sidebar retained the actual Catalog plugin entry without adding management navigation. Card-to-Detail did not invoke a Feature. The existing legacy Translation page rendered with empty text; no translation or AI request was made.

The first resize attempt scrolled the Website page instead of changing the window size. Fresh observation and an exact outer-corner drag produced the verified 841px layout; the initial capture is retained separately as a driver observation, not a narrow-layout PASS. Later user interaction caused two input pauses; after the user's explicit coordination reply, fresh observations were obtained and the remaining checks completed. That reply is not user visual acceptance.

Normal Alt+F4 closed Manager; exact-copy Manager executable process count returned to 0 while NativeHost remained. The control state reported no connected/ready Manager. Normal control-pipe exit then ended NativeHost, and final exact runtime-copy process count was 0. No forced process termination was used.

Evidence: `C:/Users/Example/AppData/Local/Temp/webtools-round5-KLt2wO/evidence/round5-runtime-smoke.json`; SHA-256 `F11C932A80812F8E2449BA009ED4AB5C901FE0A3AFBA5ADDAEBF9CF2D02DCA97`. It records 13 layout snapshots and 15 actual JPEG screenshots with hashes, identities, checks and cleanup. Limits: one Windows DPI setup (DPR 2), fallback website/plugin icons, no independent web-runtime smoke, no new external-open/drag persistence or translation execution acceptance. Viewport resizing does not establish multi-DPI acceptance.

### Verification and retained failures

| Command/check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | PASS, no lockfile change |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Initial R5 Vue TS2367 in App.vue was fixed by removing a redundant web-runtime comparison inside the narrowed branch. Rerun Vue check PASS; combined command still FAIL at existing `electron/plugins/node-command-execution.ts(112,57)` TS2345 |
| Existing focused UI/model tests | 17/23 PASS; same 6 stale expectations |
| `pnpm test` | 486/507 PASS, 21 FAIL; unique failure-name set exactly matches saved R4 log |
| `pnpm run build` | PASS; production packaging rebuilt Main/Preload/Renderer/sandbox preload after the Vue fix |
| NativeHost Checks | 70/72; same invocation-source and old per-plugin-cap assertions |
| UpdateHelper Checks | 10/10 PASS |
| Lint | NO LINT SCRIPT AVAILABLE |
| `git diff --check` | PASS; untracked report checked separately for trailing whitespace |

The full-suite failure classification remains the R4 table above: B=6 stale UI/model expectations, C=10 unrelated failures, D=5 loader/SDK fixture failures. No new R5-specific failure remained after the TS2367 correction. This records retained failures; it is not an all-tests-PASS claim. No test was rewritten to hide them. Logs: `%TEMP%/webtools-r5-{typecheck,typecheck-after-fix,focused,full,build,native,updater}.log`.

### Preview artifacts

Command: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-native-production.ps1 -PreviewOnly -PreviewName WebTools-Phase6F4B-UX-R5-Preview -PreviewUxRevision phase6f4b-ux-r5`.

R5 packaging completed successfully in its first flow. Runtime smoke used the separate verified copy after packaging, so it did not lock the canonical stage during archival. No installer was run and earlier previews were preserved.

### Final scope and next step

No source changed after successful final packaging; only this report was updated. Generated artifacts are ignored, and profiles/screenshots/raw evidence/logs remain outside Git. Branch and HEAD remain unchanged. Current Git status has 0 staged, 164 unstaged tracked entries and 63 untracked paths; no stage/commit/push/reset/stash/clean occurred.

**R5 SHARED DENSITY / UNIFIED SCROLL PREVIEW READY — USER MANUAL ACCEPTANCE PENDING.** Phase 6F-4B remains IN PROGRESS. The user's request to continue automated input is coordination only, not acceptance. Phase 6F-4C / 4D remains NOT STARTED. Stop here for user review of this Preview.

## R5 user acceptance closeout

The subsequent Phase 6F-4C instruction explicitly confirms **Phase 6F-4B USER ACCEPTED / COMPLETE**, including acceptance of the R5 UI result. This is user confirmation, not a new independently observed acceptance run. Existing test failures, measurements, artifact identities and raw evidence above remain unchanged. The prior pending-acceptance statements record their historical state. Phase 6F-4C now has separate development-only authorization; its implementation record is `phase6f4c-platform-settings-development.md`.
