# Phase 6F-4C — Platform Settings + Shared AI Foundation

Status: **Phase 6F-4C DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTED — AWAITING REVIEW**.

Phase 6F-4B: **USER ACCEPTED / COMPLETE**, explicitly confirmed by the current task instruction. Phase 6F-4D and Phase 6G: **NOT STARTED**.

Authority: approved `phase6f4-manager-platform-architecture.md`, accepted R5 density/layout, and the user's Phase 6F-4C development-only instruction. This report records source implementation and static diff review, not compilation, execution, network testing or Windows acceptance. Historical R5 results are not new 4C verification results.

## A. Implementation result

The Manager Settings long page is now organized into six compact categories. Existing owners and typed persistence paths are reused. Platform AI management separates choosing a provider to edit from choosing the global default. Provider configuration, credential operations and connection tests have explicit independent actions. Translation-specific options remain reachable in the existing Legacy Translation page.

The source was audited before editing: SettingsView/SearchEngineEditor/SuperPanelSettings, AppSettings/AI/Translation types, DataStore, PluginStore, SecretStore/Core, credential mapping, provider registry, SharedAIService, adapters, TranslationService, Manager IPC/preload, Native settings overlay, v1 permission/review and v3 Shared AI capability checks. Existing test source was read to understand contracts; no test was run or edited.

## B. Production files modified

| File | This round's change |
| --- | --- |
| `src/features/settings/SettingsView.vue` | Typed transient categories; relocates existing controls; loading/retry; unsaved/busy navigation guard; keeps existing Launcher handlers and Native authority |
| `src/features/settings/SharedAISettings.vue` (new) | Platform provider/config/default/credential/status UI using existing Host API; temporary drafts only |
| `src/features/settings/SuperPanelSettings.vue` | Exposes existing dirty/saving state only for the category-leave guard; trigger/apply/subscription logic unchanged |
| `src/features/translate/LegacyTranslationSettings.vue` (new) | Existing engine choices plus existing Qwen-MT model preference on the Legacy Translation surface |
| `src/features/translate/TranslateView.vue` | Mounts that settings section; safely refreshes service metadata/invalidate results after save; platform AI navigation; copy points to the new location |
| `src/features/plugins/PluginManagerView.vue` | Minimal built-in Translation configuration copy/link correction: existing Translation page versus platform AI; no Detail redesign or generic config API |
| `src/App.vue` | Transient AI section focus request and existing event routing; preserves Native Super Panel intent, R5 shell/scroll owner and Feature routes |
| `src/shared/ipc.ts` | Optional provider ID on the existing Manager-only connection-test API |
| `electron/preload.ts` | Forwards that optional ID through the existing connection-test channel |
| `electron/ipc/translation-handlers.ts` | Validates provider ID for the existing AI test handler; fixed, bounded error copy; existing Manager guard, timeout and disposal retained |
| `electron/ipc/settings-handlers.ts` | Fixed error copy for failed Shared AI persistence, preserving existing queue/validation/native rollback |
| `electron/services/shared-ai-service.ts` | Tests one saved provider without changing default; ordinary complete() routing unchanged |

Documentation: this report and the narrow R5 user-acceptance closeout in `phase6f4b-plugin-center-development.md`. No NativeHost source, Websites source, design tokens, dependency, packaging/configuration or production data file was edited in this round.

## C. Settings IA implemented

| Category | Actual controls / operations |
| --- | --- |
| General / 通用 | Existing Windows-login startup preference; existing Plugin Management entry |
| Launcher | Compact/expanded initial layout, current hotkey presets/recorder/Apply/Cancel, webpage engines/default/order, Everything enable/detect/path |
| Super Panel | Existing enabled state, mouse button, Press/Hold, hold duration, current registration status, Apply/Cancel/defaults |
| AI | Actual providers; per-provider model/config; global default; credential save/replace/remove; safe configuration status; explicit saved-provider connection test |
| Appearance / 外观 | System / Light / Dark via existing theme capability |
| Advanced / 高级 | Existing Host product version and navigation to the existing Plugin Management developer/diagnostic tools |

Categories are typed local navigation state, not persisted preference fields or another settings registry. R5 common scroll owner remains intact. New navigation and provider-list spacing/icons use R5 responsive tokens; existing compact controls/theme styles are reused. No global zoom, decorative redesign or alternate Manager layout.

AI UI mounts only in its category. Super Panel retains its existing unmount cleanup. Leaving a category with pending hotkey, Super Panel or AI changes requires an explicit discard decision; in-flight save/test blocks category switching. Provider switching similarly requires confirmation before discarding its unsaved draft. Credential input is cleared after save attempts, provider replacement and AI unmount; it is not kept in a hidden category or global store.

## D. General settings

Only real platform behavior is surfaced: startup to Native tray and the accepted Plugin Management entry. No placeholder preferences, account/cloud UI or plugin behavior is added. Startup writes continue through the existing typed settings API and NativeHost-owned persistence/registration.

## E. Launcher settings

All existing real controls are retained, including Hotkey System 2.0 presets/recording and Apply/Cancel semantics. Existing Settings IPC validation, serialized updates, Native synchronization and rollback are unchanged. Everything detection now has bounded UI failure handling and request-generation protection for stale returns. Detection is requested when Launcher settings are visited instead of on every Settings-page mount.

No Launcher search/index/projection/activation/ranking implementation was edited. Apps/Websites still rank above Plugin Features; there is no user preference allowing a plugin to outrank them.

## F. Super Panel settings

The existing `SuperPanelSettings.vue` is rendered in its category. Native settings deep links still select it and retain its focus request. Enabled/button/gesture/hold settings, registration status, Apply/Cancel/defaults, Main IPC and Native controller/state authority are reused. The only component change is exposing existing dirty/saving state to its parent navigation guard.

No selection capture/provider, Explorer handling, context classification, Feature matching/presentation, trigger architecture or Native code was changed. Copy Diagnostics and Quick Translation were not added.

## G. Appearance settings

Existing System/Light/Dark preferences and `applyTheme` are reused through `updateSettings({ theme })`. No new theme schema, accent editor, CSS API or marketplace.

## H. Advanced settings

Product version comes from the existing `getVersion()` API. Existing developer/runtime diagnostics remain in Plugin Management's existing Developer Tools; Advanced links there and explains the location. It does not create another collector, expose process/path/credential objects, restore temporary diagnostics, or auto-start a runtime. No reset/export operation is invented where a corresponding existing public API was not found.

## I. AI provider management

The existing registry contains OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen and custom OpenAI-compatible services. The UI obtains descriptors from the Host instead of introducing another registry. Registry identities, model defaults/hints, adapter protocols/endpoints and dependencies were not upgraded.

Each provider shows its real `configured`/`hasApiKey` metadata or an explicit unreadable-state message. “配置完整” means saved model/endpoint/credential prerequisites are satisfied; it is not a connectivity guarantee. Only a user-initiated request can show “本次连接测试成功”. The status is transient and invalidated on configuration changes; no permanent fake Connected state is saved.

Models remain bounded explicit IDs (120 characters); custom service URL and Qwen region/workspace use existing types/validation. There is no online discovery or invented universal model catalog. Provider selection edits one provider; it does not write the global default. Unsaved selection changes require confirmation.

## J. Credential / SecretStore flow

```text
User enters new credential in Manager (temporary password input)
  -> existing typed saveAIProviderKey / clearAIProviderKey
  -> existing Manager-main-frame guarded Main handler
  -> AIProviderCredentialStore
  -> SecretStore / Electron safeStorage
  -> encrypted secrets.json

Status response -> hasApiKey / configured / safe metadata only
```

Stored raw keys are never returned by a status/read API. New input necessarily passes through Manager IPC to Main once; this report does not claim that newly entered keys never exist in Renderer memory. No key is written to AppSettings, PluginStore, localStorage, diagnostics, errors or plugin DTOs. Save/replace and confirmed removal are separate from non-secret configuration saves. An unavailable/corrupt secure store is reported without returning its exception or credential payload.

The existing `ai-<providerId>` keys and custom `ai-api-key` fallback are unchanged. Explicit custom-key removal keeps the existing behavior of deleting both current and fallback keys. No automatic migration/deletion was introduced.

## K. Default provider / model semantics

`AppSettings.sharedAI.defaultProviderId` remains the single global default. Each provider owns its existing `model` setting. Empty model uses the current registry default except custom, which must provide an explicit model. Qwen region/workspace remain provider metadata; Qwen-MT's translation-specific model remains separate.

Configuration/default saves fetch current settings, clone only the known non-secret Shared AI fields, and update through the existing serialized Settings handler. Other providers are preserved when editing one. Default changes do not save unfinished provider/key drafts and never implicitly test connectivity. Selecting an unconfigured provider is represented honestly; ordinary non-AI operation remains available. UI limits do not replace Host validation.

## L. SharedAIService changes

The existing `testConnection(signal, providerId?)` supports testing a selected saved provider without altering global default. Omitting the ID retains the prior default-provider behavior. The existing Manager IPC channel validates the optional enum; its 30-second AbortController timeout and Manager-lifecycle disposal are retained. It returns provider name/model only, never the test reply or credential. Leaving the AI category ignores stale UI callbacks; an already-dispatched test remains governed by the existing Main timeout/disposal, not a new cancellation protocol.

`complete()` and its plugin consumers still use the global default, existing adapter routing and Main credential retrieval. No second service, provider instances, background AI job, registry, IPC channel or provider override for plugins was added. Connection/storage/configuration errors use bounded product copy rather than raw exceptions.

## M. Plugin Shared AI capability boundary

Existing v1 `sharedAI.complete` retains requested/granted validation, review/confirm and Host invocation. Existing v3 Web/Node path retains current identity/session/generation, capability/grant/gesture/consent, input/rate/token bounds and Main-owned service effects. Web response exposes bounded result text, not provider credentials or SecretStore access.

No capability, Manifest/API version, SDK, PluginStore, plugin classification or grant semantics changed. Installation/startup/ordinary plugin use remain AI-optional. The selected-provider test is exposed only through trusted Manager IPC; it is not a plugin provider-selection API.

## N. Translation compatibility

The existing Legacy Manager Translation page/service and MyMemory/AI/Qwen-MT adapters remain. Engine options moved out of platform Settings into a compact collapsible section on that same page. Its existing language controls and persistence remain; Qwen-MT model uses the existing bounded TranslationSettings field/validator. Saving engine/model cancels the current request/timer and refreshes metadata with a generation check, without starting translation because of the configuration save itself.

Source/target languages, normal text auto-translation, handoff and Google webpage invocation behavior were not redesigned. No v3 Translation Runtime, Plugin Window, result contract or second translation service was introduced. Qwen-MT continues to read the existing platform Qwen credential/region/workspace through Main. Shared AI translation continues to use the global platform default. Plugin Detail's existing Translation configuration entry now distinguishes the old Translation page from platform AI; the rest of Detail is unchanged.

## O. Plugin configuration boundary

No generic plugin configuration UI/contract/schema/API was implemented. Existing v1 compatibility settings and PluginStore config/data namespaces are untouched. 6F-4D owns the separate Manager management and runtime config authority paths. The temporary Legacy Translation section is not a generic plugin configuration framework.

## P. Deferred AI Tools / MCP

No AI Agent, autonomous execution, AI Tool Registry, Plugin Tools, MCP client/server, resources/prompts, tool grants/approval, memory or placeholder pages. Feature Quick Result/Preview and Super Panel translation remain deferred to the approved pre-6G design/dogfood boundary.

## Q. Persistence / migration decisions

No migration required. Non-secret values retain `AppSettings` v2 and existing DataStore normalization. Native Launcher/theme/startup values retain their Native overlay/controller paths; Super Panel retains its existing Native state. Plugin config/data and SecretStore remain separate. Old custom AI aliases/fallback and Translation preferences are not deleted or relocated on disk. Only presentation/category ownership changes.

## R. Architecture deviations and review limits

Architecture deviations: **NONE identified by static source review**. Narrow contract extension: optional provider ID on the already-existing Manager connection-test operation, never on plugin `complete()`. No historical design or measurement data was rewritten.

This round establishes implementation only. It does not certify compilation, persisted restart behavior, actual provider calls, Windows hotkeys/startup or GUI appearance. Those require separately authorized verification. Existing `settings-translation-copy.test.mjs` reads MyMemory copy directly from SettingsView; after the intentional ownership move it refers to the old source location. This static contract mismatch is recorded for the future authorized test-update round; no test was changed/run to hide it. Earlier R5 test failures are historical, not claimed as current 4C results.

## S. Tests modified

**NONE.** No tests, fixtures, verification scripts, evidence, hash baselines or packaging artifacts were edited. No tests/typecheck/lint/build/package/application startup/runtime smoke/manual acceptance were run. Only source/docs reads, file edits, Git status/diff and whitespace review were used.

## T. Git status summary

Branch: `codex/shared-ai-translation-2.0`. HEAD: `707c5673dff479285b34a5b441bec9d3b725c737`. Existing dirty work was preserved; this round's changes were compared with temporary pre-edit source copies outside the repository. No stage/commit/push/reset/checkout/restore/stash/clean/merge/rebase/tag occurred.

Final static Git check: `git diff --check` exit 0; staged files 0; unstaged tracked entries 166; untracked paths 66; total status entries 232 (baseline 227). The five added status entries are two previously clean modified source files (`SharedAIService`, `TranslateView`) plus the two new components and this report. Other edited files were already dirty/untracked at task start. The full scoped Git diff also includes pre-existing work; temporary source snapshots were used to distinguish this round's edits. New report/source files were separately included in whitespace review (0 trailing-whitespace lines); `git diff --check` alone does not check untracked files.

## U. Next step

Review the Phase 6F-4C source and ownership changes, then separately authorize focused regression/typecheck/build/runtime/manual verification. No Preview was generated in this development-only round. Do not enter 6F-4D or Phase 6G on this task's completion.

## Verification / Preview

Verification was performed on 2026-10-12 against branch `codex/shared-ai-translation-2.0`, HEAD `707c5673dff479285b34a5b441bec9d3b725c737`. The working tree was already dirty; the preview metadata records `dirty: true`. No existing work was reset, staged, committed, or pushed. Product source was not changed during this verification round; the one authorized stale-test update is recorded below.

### A–AA acceptance summary

**A. Overall Verdict** — `PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS — READY FOR USER MANUAL ACCEPTANCE`. No confirmed Phase 6F-4C product regression was found. Runtime coverage has the environment limitations listed below; this is not Phase 6F-4C completion or certification.

**B. Verification Environment** — Windows, Node/pnpm environment in this checkout; pnpm `9.15.9`. Dev Manager userData resolved as `C:\Users\Example\AppData\Roaming\WebTools-Dev`, whose real path is under the Codex package LocalCache (`C:\Users\Example\AppData\Local\Packages\OpenAI.Codex_2p2nqsd0c76g0\LocalCache\Roaming\WebTools-Dev`). It was newly created for this session and separate from `%APPDATA%\Nook` and `D:\webtools`, but was not a strict TEMP profile because of the Windows reparse/junction path. No production installation, production profile, real credential, or paid provider was used.

**C. Files Modified During Verification** — `src/features/settings/settings-translation-copy.test.mjs` was narrowly updated because its old assertion read Translation copy from the former SettingsView owner. This report received this separate Verification / Preview section. No product source was edited during verification. Preview outputs are under ignored `release/`.

**D. Typecheck Result** — `pnpm run typecheck`: FAIL at `electron/plugins/node-command-execution.ts(112,57)`, `unknown` not assignable to `string`. The diagnostic is in unrelated pre-existing dirty Phase 6E runtime work and is outside the Phase 6F-4C source changes. `pnpm exec vue-tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.web.json`: PASS.

**E. Automated Test Result** — `pnpm test`: 486/507 PASS, 21 FAIL. The 21 failures match the repository's existing 6F-4B/Phase 6E–4F baseline, including plugin catalog/runtime expectations, Native Manager protocol expectations, feature invocation/projection limits, installer architecture assertions, and old Favorites/Search assertions. No unrelated failing test was modified. The Phase 6F-4C-focused set (settings/Translation copy, SharedAIService, Translation IPC/service and request-gate checks): 22/22 PASS. The final full-suite failures are non-blocking for this change and remain visible rather than being suppressed.

**F. Build Result** — `pnpm run build`: PASS for Electron Main, preload, renderer, and sandbox preload.

**G. NativeHost / UpdateHelper Result** — NativeHost Checks: 70/72; the two failures are the same existing unsupported-invocation-source and 17-features-per-plugin expectations recorded in the prior Phase 6F-4B baseline. UpdateHelper Checks: 10/10 PASS. NativeHost build emitted unresolved UIAutomation reference-assembly warnings; the build/package completed.

**H. Settings IA Runtime Result** — The current dev Manager rendered and switched among General, Launcher, Super Panel, AI, Appearance, and Advanced. Normal-width Settings scrolling and control density were usable. Super Panel values/status could not be verified against a NativeHost because this standalone dev Manager had no NativeHost connection; the UI reported that limitation. No claim of Super Panel runtime PASS is made.

**I. General Result** — Startup preference rendered and the existing Plugin Management entry opened the existing management page with its bundled Translation card. Startup state was not changed. No duplicate management page was created.

**J. Launcher Regression Result** — Display mode, hotkey, search-engine, and Everything controls rendered. Everything was not detected in this environment. A hotkey draft triggered the discard guard; continuing then cancelling restored the active `Ctrl+Alt+Space`. No hotkey was applied and no Launcher redesign or priority change was made.

**K. Super Panel Regression Result** — The settings surface was present, but NativeHost was disconnected, so live registration/status, Apply/Cancel/default behavior, and unsaved-draft navigation against the real NativeHost were not runtime-tested. This is an environment limitation, not a product PASS or confirmed product failure.

**L. Appearance / Advanced Result** — System, Light, and Dark themes switched and persisted in the dev profile; System was restored. A 900×700 renderer viewport emulation reported no horizontal overflow (`scrollWidth`, `clientWidth`, and body width all 900). This was not an OS-level window resize. Advanced showed the app version and the existing developer/diagnostic entry opened the same Plugin Management page; no additional runtime process appeared.

**M. Shared AI Provider Result** — Actual Host descriptors were observed for OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Custom/OpenAI-compatible. No second Renderer-owned provider registry was found.

**N. Provider Editing vs Default Result** — With OpenAI as the global default, selecting DeepSeek for editing left the default as OpenAI. Only the explicit default-provider action changed the global default to DeepSeek. An unfinished provider draft was not implicitly saved when switching away.

**O. Provider Persistence Result** — A non-secret DeepSeek model/config value (`deepseek-chat`) and the explicit global default survived closing and restarting the dev Manager under the same newly created profile. Cross-provider preservation with multiple independently populated provider records was not separately exercised. The profile was then returned through the normal app API to the baseline OpenAI default, empty provider map, System theme, and startup disabled. Existing unrelated production settings were not touched.

**P. Credential / SecretStore Lifecycle Result** — A synthetic non-production credential was saved, replaced, observed only through safe `hasApiKey`/`configured` status, persisted across Manager restart without reappearing in the password input or status payload, then removed through the normal UI confirmation path. Final status was absent/unconfigured; input was empty. No credential value was written to this report or intentionally printed. SecretStore failure handling was source-reviewed only; no destructive corruption simulation was performed.

**Q. Connection Test Result** — Focused mocked SharedAIService verification confirmed selected-provider testing does not change the global default and normal completion continues to use the global default. No external provider request was made; external connectivity is **NOT VERIFIED** and no paid quota was used.

**R. Unsaved / In-flight Guard Result** — Provider switch and category-leave discard guards were exercised; Launcher hotkey draft protection was exercised. Save/test busy-state, stale-generation and callback cleanup paths were source-reviewed, but no delayed operation, timeout, or cancellation race was forced. Super Panel draft guard remains unverified at runtime because NativeHost was unavailable.

**S. SharedAIService `complete()` Regression Result** — PASS by focused mocked check and source contract: `complete()` uses the global default, not the Settings editor selection or last tested provider.

**T. Plugin Shared AI Security Boundary Result** — PASS by source/contract review: existing plugin identity/session, capability/grant, consent/gesture, and bounded I/O checks remain; no SecretStore, raw provider credential, arbitrary provider-selection, or AI-settings management authority was added to plugins.

**U. Legacy Translation Result** — Ownership is correct by source and the focused Translation regression assertions passed. The actual Translation page was unavailable in this Manager session because the built-in Translation card failed closed with `UNSAFE_PATH`: the dev profile's real path crossed a reparse/junction ancestor in the Codex AppData environment. Therefore page rendering, language controls, persistence UI, and Google webpage action were **NOT RUNTIME VERIFIED**. No translation request or Translation 2.0 runtime was started. This environment result is not treated as a confirmed Phase 6F-4C product regression.

**V. Stale Tests Updated** — `src/features/settings/settings-translation-copy.test.mjs`: old expectation read MyMemory/automatic-translation copy directly from `SettingsView.vue`, although Phase 6F-4C intentionally moved engine/settings copy to `LegacyTranslationSettings.vue` and retained automatic translation in `TranslateView.vue`. The updated assertions read those intended owners and preserve checks for MyMemory copy, no automatic send on engine switch, the 450 ms pause behavior, and no automatic dispatch. Focused test set passed 22/22.

**W. Failures and Classification** —

- `pnpm run typecheck` diagnostic in `electron/plugins/node-command-execution.ts`: **C. PRE-EXISTING / UNRELATED FAILURE**; unrelated source and dirty Phase 6E runtime work.
- The 21 `pnpm test` failures: **C. PRE-EXISTING / UNRELATED FAILURE**, matching the prior 6F-4B test baseline; they are in plugin catalog/runtime, Native Manager/feature contracts, dev preview, installer architecture, and prior Favorites/Search assertions. The direct 6F-4C stale Translation-copy test was updated instead of deleted and now passes.
- NativeHost Checks 2/72: **C. PRE-EXISTING / UNRELATED FAILURE**, matching prior Phase 6F-4B baseline.
- Translation runtime and NativeHost-dependent Super Panel checks: **D. ENVIRONMENT / TOOLCHAIN LIMITATION** (`UNSAFE_PATH` and no connected NativeHost); no product defect confirmed.
- No failure was classified as a confirmed Phase 6F-4C regression or unknown blocker.

**X. Runtime UI Smoke** — Current dev renderer was inspected at normal desktop width, Light/Dark/System themes, and a 900×700 emulated viewport. Settings categories, provider selector, configuration fields, safe credential state, buttons, and discard dialogs rendered without observed overlap or horizontal overflow. A physical OS window resize was not performed. The dev Manager was closed normally; its Electron process group returned to zero before restart and again after final close. No production app was closed or modified.

**Y. Preview Packaging Evidence** — Canonical command:

```powershell
pnpm run package:win -- -PreviewOnly -PreviewName WebTools-Phase6F4C-Shared-AI-Preview -PreviewUxRevision phase6f4c-shared-ai
```

- Canonical stage: `D:\workspace\HomePage\release\native-preview-20261012-102211\stage\application` (550 files).

**Z. Git Status** — Branch `codex/shared-ai-translation-2.0`; HEAD `707c5673dff479285b34a5b441bec9d3b725c737`. Worktree remains dirty with unrelated pre-existing work. Verification added the stale test change and this report section only; no files were staged, and no commit/push was made. `git diff --check` exits 0 (Git emitted only line-ending conversion warnings).

**AA. Phase Status** — `Phase 6F-4C VERIFICATION COMPLETE — AWAITING USER MANUAL ACCEPTANCE`. `Phase 6F-4D NOT STARTED`. `Phase 6G NOT STARTED`.
