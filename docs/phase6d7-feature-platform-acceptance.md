# Phase 6D-7A — Feature Platform Packaged Acceptance Preparation

## 1. Status

PHASE 6D-7A ACCEPTANCE PREPARATION COMPLETE

PHASE 6D-7 HUMAN ACCEPTANCE — USER CONFIRMED PASS (14/14)

Phase 6D-1 through 6D-6 remain complete/approved as recorded by their reports. This closeout rechecked Security Gates 2 and 3 against the current implementation and recorded the user's packaged Windows acceptance. Phase 6E has not started.
## 2. Source baseline

The acceptance candidate was built from the current, intentionally dirty working tree before this report was added.

| Identity | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `codex/shared-ai-translation-2.0` |
| HEAD | `eb375590134fcdc28fa5a6a8b6cf18d9b198a9ea` |
| Upstream | `origin/codex/shared-ai-translation-2.0` |
| Divergence | ahead 3 / behind 0 |
| Candidate source state | dirty; no staged files |
| Product version | `0.1.0` |
| Build output identity | `release/native-production-20261006-235932` |
| Installer file time | 2026-10-07 00:00:33–00:03:35, machine local time (Asia/Hong_Kong) |
| Node / pnpm / .NET SDK | Node `v24.21.0`; pnpm `9.15.9`; .NET SDK `10.0.401` |
| Electron / electron-builder | Electron `44.4.5`; electron-builder `26.15.3` |

The installer was produced with the existing `pnpm run package:win` script. The build output's `native-production-*` folder and the copied artifacts are ignored/disposable; the installer is an **acceptance candidate**, not a release candidate or signed release. The newly created 6D-7A report and guide are not part of the already-built application.

At packaging time, `git diff --stat` reported **27 tracked files, 1,301 insertions, 127 deletions**. `git status --short` had 27 modified paths and 14 untracked paths. These changes comprise the earlier Launcher work and uncheckpointed Phase 6D-4/6D-5/6D-6 layers; they were preserved and not staged.

The exact source status at packaging time was:

Layer interpretation:

- **Pre-existing Launcher:** `docs/webtools-phase5i-launcher-improvement.md`, `native/WebTools.NativeHost.Checks/Program.cs`, `native/WebTools.NativeHost/MainWindow.xaml`, and `native/WebTools.NativeHost/MainWindow.xaml.cs`. The last three have later Phase 6D additions in separate hunks.
- **Phase 6D-4:** Feature Projection v2 cache/search and publisher/client integration, focused checks, and `docs/phase6d4-native-feature-search.md`.
- **Phase 6D-5:** Manager OS peer identity/authentication, launch identity and pipe integration, checks, and `docs/phase6d5-pipe-peer-authentication.md`.
- **Phase 6D-6:** Main live invocation authority, bounded invocation protocol/queue, route acknowledgement, focused tests, and `docs/phase6d6-feature-invocation.md`.
- **Phase 6D-7A:** this preparation report only. Candidate packages, SDK author project, and profile data are outside the tracked source tree or under ignored `release/`.

## 3. Automated acceptance results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm run typecheck` | PASS |
| `pnpm test` | PASS — 410/410; Node emitted `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` performance warnings only |
| `pnpm run build` | PASS — Electron Main, preload, Vue Renderer |
| NativeHost Release `win-x64` self-contained publish | PASS, performed by `pnpm run package:win` |
| NativeHost Checks | PASS — 71/71, including D4 projection/search, D5 authenticated peer, and D6 invocation/queue fixtures |
| UpdateHelper Checks | PASS — 10/10 |
| `node --test scripts/release-contract.test.mjs` | PASS — 13/13 |
| `pnpm run package:win` | PASS — NativeHost/UpdateHelper publish, Electron `win-unpacked`, NSIS compile |
| Cover-install ordering smoke | PASS — old uninstall completed before replacement files remained |
| Packager Unicode/space-path smoke | PASS — isolated `WebTools Phase 4F 中文 空格` install, Manager discovery, self-uninstall |
| Candidate source/archive plugin workflow | PASS — SDK 1.1.0 external author workflow below |
| `git diff --check` before this report | PASS — only LF/CRLF working-copy warnings |

The package script's smoke install used only `release/native-production-20261006-235932/smoke-install/WebTools Phase 4F 中文 空格` and the dedicated HKCU test identity `WebToolsNativePhase4FTest`. After the script completed, that install directory was removed, the dedicated registry entry was absent, and the remaining `smoke-install` parent directory was empty. This did not run the user-facing candidate installer or touch the production install/profile.

Security regression evidence is automated: projection/cache validation and stale revisions, actual OS-observed pipe client PID, wrong peer/image and PID/start identity rejection, pre-auth update/invocation rejection, duplicate replay, stale Manager, and disable/uninstall/grant-revoke after cached projection are covered by the focused Node and NativeHost check suites. No spoofing exercise is assigned to the human tester. The isolated NativeHost child-process/pipe checks are **not** real packaged Electron Manager acceptance.

## 4. Acceptance candidate

| Artifact | Value |
|---|---|
| User-accessible installer | `C:\Users\Public\Documents\WebTools-Phase6D7-Acceptance-20261007\WebTools-Setup-0.1.0.exe` |
| Build output installer | `D:\System default\Desktop\HomePage\release\native-production-20261006-235932\WebTools-Setup-0.1.0.exe` |
| Size | 191,520,104 bytes |
| SHA-256 | `1A595C0E93AE38AEEDD1808ADC4EFEF492E194A1B657397C0B0B5829212DBB05` |
| Signature | NotSigned |
| Manager in build output | `release/native-production-20261006-235932/stage/manager/WebTools.exe`; complete `win-unpacked` tree is in `manager-build/win-unpacked` |
| NativeHost in build output | `release/native-production-20261006-235932/stage/host/WebTools.NativeHost.exe` |

The Public Documents copy is byte-identical to the built installer by SHA-256. Its new acceptance directory is ACL-restricted: current user, Administrators, and SYSTEM have full control; `BUILTIN\Users` has read/execute only. Windows may show an unknown-publisher/SmartScreen warning because this is unsigned. It is a local acceptance candidate only.

## 5. Test Plugin

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| User-accessible package | `C:\Users\Public\Documents\WebTools-Phase6D7-Acceptance-20261007\WebTools-6D-Acceptance-Plugin.wtplugin` |
| Build output package | `D:\System default\Desktop\HomePage\release\native-production-20261006-235932\acceptance-plugin\WebTools-6D-Acceptance-Plugin.wtplugin` |
| Size / SHA-256 | 483 bytes / `F99443A096DE0749B970360815EF796D030B5DFDA96614029EE22DA07147F0B4` |
| Plugin ID / version | `org.webtools.phase6d7.acceptance` / `1.0.0` |
| Manifest / API | Manifest v1 / API major 1 / minimum Host `0.1.0` |
| Requested capability | `manager.page` only |
| Contents | One static `home` Manager page with a heading and paragraph; no actions, assets, AI, network, or external executable |
| Validation | SDK source validation PASS; packed archive validate PASS; inspect PASS. Host install-time validation/consent remains authoritative during manual install. |

It was created outside the repository with the Phase 6B public SDK package tarball (`@webtools/plugin-sdk@1.1.0`, 20,575 bytes, SHA-256 `EF5F4023C639479BB56FBF6EA4731406DC1EA2CADBE30A331FA903C7A9A9C264`). The generated basic starter was installed with that local tarball, typechecked, validated, packed, and inspected using:

```powershell
pnpm exec webtools-plugin create webtools-phase6d7-acceptance --host-version 0.1.0 --id org.webtools.phase6d7.acceptance --name "WebTools 6D Acceptance Plugin" --description "Minimal declarative page for Phase 6D Feature invocation acceptance." --author "WebTools Acceptance"
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run validate
pnpm run plugin:pack
pnpm run inspect
pnpm exec webtools-plugin validate C:\Users\Public\Documents\WebTools-Phase6D7-Acceptance-20261007\WebTools-6D-Acceptance-Plugin.wtplugin --host-version 0.1.0
pnpm exec webtools-plugin inspect C:\Users\Public\Documents\WebTools-Phase6D7-Acceptance-20261007\WebTools-6D-Acceptance-Plugin.wtplugin --host-version 0.1.0
```

The SDK reported only its expected `GENERIC_ICON` warning because the minimal starter declares no icon. It uses the Host's generic plugin icon. SDK `validate`/`inspect` are author feedback, not install-time authority; the Manager Host must validate the package and request consent on install.

## 6. Isolated install and profile paths

**Use a fresh, separate Windows user account and sign into it as a separate Windows session** (recommended local account name: `WebTools6D7Test`). Do not use “Run as different user” in the existing session; the NativeHost uses a session-local single-instance mutex. Do not run the candidate installer from the current production user's session. If this is a new profile, Windows will normally resolve the paths below under `C:\Users\WebTools6D7Test`; use that account's actual `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and `%APPDATA%` if Windows assigned a suffixed profile directory.

Under the separate test account, the current installer defaults to:

- Install root: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\WebTools`
- Native entry point: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\WebTools\WebTools.NativeHost.exe`
- Manager: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\WebTools\Manager\WebTools.exe`
- Native/Manager user profile: `%APPDATA%\Nook`
- Native local cache: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WebTools`
- Test user's startup/uninstall registration: that test account's `HKCU`

These resolve under the new account's Windows profile, separate from the current `D:\webtools` install, current user's `%APPDATA%\Nook`, startup registration, and Favorites/settings/secrets. No manual registry or JSON editing is required. If a separate test account cannot be used, **do not install this candidate under the current account**; stop and ask for an alternate isolated test environment.

The public acceptance folder is readable by the test account and not writable by the general Users group. Open the human guide from that folder after copying completes.

## 7. Human prerequisites and diagnostics

1. Create or use a clean standard Windows test account and sign into it as a separate session.
2. Confirm it has no existing WebTools installation/profile. Do not use this account to access real Favorites, credentials, or AI tokens.
3. In that session open the shared folder above, run the candidate installer, and keep the installation directory at the default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\WebTools`.
4. Use Task Manager → Details for process checks. Confirm the test account's `WebTools.NativeHost.exe` remains; for Electron counts inspect executable location and count only `WebTools.exe` processes from this test install's `Manager` directory. Do not count or close other applications by process name.
5. NativeHost diagnostic CSV, if needed, is written on normal exit under the test account's `%TEMP%\WebToolsNativeHost-PoC\run-<timestamp>-<PID>.csv`. It contains host/runtime, display, PID, hotkey/search timing, and lifecycle events; error paths can include local path text. Keep it local unless requested and redact paths before sharing. No translation text or AI token is needed for this acceptance.

Do not install over `D:\webtools`, do not use the current user's `%APPDATA%\Nook`, and do not enable a real AI provider or enter any secret. Successful packaged Feature invocation is black-box runtime acceptance; Gate 2's internal pipe-authentication evidence comes from code review and focused automated checks. The manual tester does not perform spoofing attacks.

## 8. Human checklist (14 steps)

The user confirmed that the packaged Windows acceptance completed with 14/14 PASS. This is USER CONFIRMED PASS, not CODEX AUTOMATED PASS or INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED. The report supplied by the user did not include machine-captured PIDs, timestamps, registry snapshots, or logs. Step-by-step results are recorded in the Phase 6D-7B closeout addendum below. No automated negative security tests need to be repeated.

| # | PASS / FAIL — action and expected result |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Install in the separate test account. Start WebTools. One NativeHost tray instance appears; with Manager closed, no `WebTools.exe` from this test install is running. |
| 2 | Open Launcher with the configured hotkey. Confirm it receives input and can search locally. Hide it; NativeHost remains in the tray. |
| 3 | From the Native tray open Plugin Center. It opens the Manager; repeated navigation requests reuse that Manager. |
| 4 | In Plugin Center install `WebTools-6D-Acceptance-Plugin.wtplugin`; approve only `manager.page`. Confirm it is enabled. |
| 5 | Open Launcher and use an empty query, then search the plugin name `WebTools 6D Acceptance Plugin` and its Feature entry/page label. The basic starter currently uses the same text for both; confirm one Feature row appears. |
| 6 | With Manager already open, click the Feature row. Confirm the acceptance page opens and no second Manager process/window is created. |
| 7 | Close Manager normally. In Task Manager verify all `WebTools.exe` processes from this install exit while NativeHost remains in the tray. |
| 8 | With Manager closed, search the Feature again. It remains discoverable and the search itself does not start Manager/Electron. |
| 9 | Click the cached Feature (cold path). Confirm one Manager starts and the right acceptance page opens. This is black-box invocation acceptance and does not inspect internal pipe authentication. |
| 10 | Disable the plugin in Plugin Center. After the projection refresh, confirm the Launcher Feature row disappears. No stale-row race was deliberately manufactured or tested. |
| 11 | Re-enable the plugin. Confirm the Feature returns and opens correctly. |
| 12 | Close Manager, exit NativeHost from its tray, and start the test installation again. Confirm plugin enabled state persists, the Feature appears once, and local search does not start Manager. |
| 13 | Uninstall the test plugin in Plugin Center. Confirm the Feature disappears. Close/reopen Launcher or restart the test NativeHost if the current projection needs a refresh; the removed Feature must not return. |
| 14 | Search `翻译` and `translation`, invoke the built-in Translation Feature, and confirm Translation opens with no discovery query prefilled. Then use the existing contextual Translation action with `hello world` and confirm it still carries that exact text. Close Manager normally; Electron returns to zero and NativeHost remains. |

For process checks, “Electron zero” means no Manager-root/helper process whose executable belongs to this test installation's `Manager` directory; NativeHost must remain. Do not infer this from the total number of Task Manager groups.

## 9. Packaged peer-auth evidence

USER CONFIRMED PASS: during packaged acceptance the user observed the cached Feature invoking Manager and opening the acceptance page, including the cold path, without a second Manager instance. This is black-box packaged invocation evidence; it does not independently expose or measure internal pipe authentication. Gate 2 OS identity checks are supported by current code review and automated D5 checks. Do not expose pipe names, raw protocol payloads, or authentication internals in UI evidence.

## 10. Development Job inheritance item

`DEV ACCEPTANCE ITEM — NOT REQUIRED FOR THE NORMAL PACKAGED CHECKLIST`: NativeHost development launch → Node wrapper (if applicable) → Electron Manager must place the actual Electron peer in the expected Windows Job and authenticate/invoke successfully. No real development GUI launch was performed here. Only run this item in a separate authorized developer environment; it does not block the user's packaged GUI checklist.

## 11. Expected process lifecycle

```text
Cold test NativeHost: 1 NativeHost, 0 Manager/Electron
Open Plugin Center / Feature: 1 Manager process group
Close Manager normally: 0 test Manager/Electron, NativeHost remains
Invoke cached Feature: one Manager starts/reuses and opens the target page
Close Manager normally again: 0 test Manager/Electron, NativeHost remains
```

## 12. Failure reporting template

If a checklist item fails, reply with:

```text
FAIL — step <number>
Expected:
Actual:
What I clicked/typed:
Screenshot (optional):
```

Do not send secrets or raw diagnostic files. I will classify a reproducible issue P0/P1/P2/P3 and prepare a focused fix only if needed; no failure has been reported yet.

## 13. Findings

- P0: 0
- P1: 0
- Blocking P2: 0
- Non-blocking P2: 0
- P3: 2 non-blocking evidence/artifact limitations:
  - The local acceptance installer is unsigned and may trigger SmartScreen/unknown-publisher confirmation; the user's installation acceptance passed, but no production-signing claim is made.
  - A real development Node-to-Electron Job-inheritance GUI run was not performed. The implementation checks expected Electron image and private Job membership and fails closed when it cannot prove membership.

The user completed the real packaged installation and GUI acceptance described below. The packager's disposable smoke remains separate automated packaging evidence. No production install or current-user profile was used for this acceptance.
## 14. Manual acceptance result

MANUAL WINDOWS ACCEPTANCE — USER CONFIRMED PASS (14/14)

The user confirmed that all remaining manual operations passed without issues. The closeout addendum records only the observations supplied by the user. No PID, exact operation time, registry-before snapshot, screenshots, or machine logs were supplied, so this report does not claim independent per-item machine capture.
## 15. Artifact handoff

The user-accessible files are in:

```text
C:\Users\Public\Documents\WebTools-Phase6D7-Acceptance-20261007\
  WebTools-Setup-0.1.0.exe
  WebTools-6D-Acceptance-Plugin.wtplugin
  PHASE6D7-USER-CHECKLIST.md
```

This shared directory grants the current account/Admins/SYSTEM full control and ordinary `BUILTIN\Users` read/execute only. All candidate/build artifacts under repository `release/` remain ignored. At the 6D-7A artifact handoff, no files had been staged, committed, or pushed. The later 6D-7B local checkpoint is recorded below; no acceptance artifact was installed into the production location.
## 16. Phase 6D-7B Closeout

### User-confirmed Windows acceptance

The user reported that the real packaged Windows acceptance passed all 14 items. Every item below is labeled USER CONFIRMED PASS. Step 9 was covered by the cold invocation behavior already observed during acceptance; it was not repeated as a separate test.

| Step | Result | User-reported observation |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 — Installed lifecycle baseline | USER CONFIRMED PASS | The isolated test install started NativeHost and kept it resident; with Manager closed the test install's WebTools.exe count was zero. |
| 2 — Native Launcher behavior | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Hotkey, input, local/file search, and hide worked; searching did not start Manager. |
| 3 — Manager startup and reuse | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Tray → Plugin Center started Manager; repeated navigation reused it, with no second Manager observed. |
| 4 — Declarative plugin install and consent | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Import showed the unverified-publisher warning without auto-granting. Only manager.page was requested; consent showed only “Add Manager Page”; the page appeared after approval with no undeclared capability observed. Plugin: org.webtools.phase6d7.acceptance, version 1.0.0. |
| 5 — Launcher Feature discovery | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Empty query and “webtool” showed one WebTools 6D Acceptance Plugin Feature. Contextual Translation and prior local/file search behavior remained available. |
| 6 — Warm Feature invocation | USER CONFIRMED PASS | With Manager already open, invoking the Feature opened the acceptance page and did not start a second Manager. |
| 7 — Manager shutdown | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Normal Manager close returned the test install's WebTools.exe processes to zero while NativeHost remained running. |
| 8 — Cached discovery with Manager closed | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Searching “webtool” still found the Feature while Electron was zero; search alone did not start WebTools.exe/Electron. |
| 9 — Cold Feature invocation | USER CONFIRMED PASS — covered by observed cold invocation behavior during acceptance | The user observed the cached Feature start/reuse Manager and open the acceptance page. This was not a separately repeated test. |
| 10 — Disable synchronization | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Disabling the plugin removed its Feature from Launcher. No stale-row race was deliberately manufactured or claimed as tested. |
| 11 — Re-enable synchronization | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Re-enabling restored the Feature and it opened the acceptance page. |
| 12 — NativeHost restart persistence | USER CONFIRMED PASS | After Manager and NativeHost were exited and WebTools restarted, the enabled Feature remained once and search did not start Electron. |
| 13 — Plugin uninstall cleanup | USER CONFIRMED PASS | Uninstall removed the Feature from Launcher; no residue was observed. |
| 14 — Translation Feature and contextual handoff | USER CONFIRMED PASS | “翻译” and “translation” opened Translation without prefilling the discovery query; the contextual “hello world” action opened Translation with that exact text. |

These are user-supplied black-box observations. They are not CODEX AUTOMATED PASS, not independent process instrumentation, and do not establish unreported PIDs, timestamps, registry snapshots, or other internal details.

### Current code and Security Gate review

- Gate 1 — WebContents isolation: DEFERRED TO PHASE 6E. No implementation was added in this closeout.
- Gate 2 — Actual Pipe Peer Authentication: COMPLETE for the implemented boundary and focused automated checks. ManagerPeerIdentity.cs obtains the pipe client PID from GetNamedPipeClientProcessId, retains and checks process handles and creation FILETIME, canonical executable image paths, liveness, and launch generation. Packaged peers must match the retained launched Manager identity. Development peers must have the expected Electron image and be observed in the private launch Job. NativeManagerPipeServer.cs authenticates before protocol processing, permits only hello before handshake, rechecks current peer identity, and protects requests with operation leases. Identity/API failures reject the peer. Phase6D5Checks covers actual Windows pipe PID observation and rejection cases. The user-confirmed packaged invocation is black-box acceptance; it does not replace those internal checks. Development Job inheritance was not exercised through a real dev GUI launch and remains the P3 item above.
- Gate 3 — Projection Fail-Closed: COMPLETE. NativeFeatureProjectionStore.cs validates an exact closed schema, rejects duplicate/invalid rows and bounds overflow, retains the last valid snapshot on rejected updates, and loads corrupt or oversized cache as an empty index. The cache is presentation/search data only.
- Gate 4 — Network connection-level enforcement: DEFERRED TO PHASE 6E. No implementation was added in this closeout.

### Feature invocation authority

Native sends a bounded request containing only the exact FeatureRef and fixed launcher source (NativeFeatureInvocationProtocol.cs). The Native projection/cache and search row do not authorize execution. Electron Main's FeatureInvocationService dispatches through PluginManager.authorizeAndDispatchFeature, which rechecks current Manager session, enabled/active state, package hash/integrity, manager.page grant, exact FeatureRef and current page under the mutation queue. Main selects the route from that authoritative result; the Renderer resolves the current catalog route and returns a correlated acknowledgement. Request replay is bounded and at-most-once per authenticated Manager session; Native queue and transport are bounded. The built-in Translation Feature passes null text context, while the separate contextual Translation command carries only the user's explicit text.

### Fresh automated closeout validation

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| pnpm run typecheck | PASS |
| pnpm test | PASS — 410/410; Node emitted existing MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON performance warnings only |
| pnpm run build | PASS — Main, preload, and Renderer |
| dotnet run --project native/WebTools.NativeHost.Checks/WebTools.NativeHost.Checks.csproj --configuration Release | PASS — 71/71, including D4/D5/D6 checks and compiled Launcher XAML startup |
| dotnet run --project native/WebTools.UpdateHelper.Checks/WebTools.UpdateHelper.Checks.csproj --configuration Release | PASS — 10/10 |
| node --test scripts/release-contract.test.mjs | PASS — 13/13 |
| git diff --check | PASS — Git emitted only existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy notices |

No installer stress run, repeated GUI acceptance, Phase 4G stress/soak, production installation, or Phase 6E work was performed.

### Git checkpoint and final decision

The pre-closeout source state was branch codex/shared-ai-translation-2.0 at HEAD eb375590134fcdc28fa5a6a8b6cf18d9b198a9ea, ahead 3 / behind 0, with 27 modified paths, 15 untracked paths and no staged files. The worktree layers together the preserved earlier Launcher Improvement and Phase 6D-4/5/6 changes. Mixed Launcher files were retained intact; no historical hunk was discarded. The exact staging list and staged diff were reviewed before creating this local checkpoint. The checkpoint includes no installer, Public Documents artifact, generated build output, user profile, token, or secret. No push was made.

PHASE 6D COMPLETE

FEATURE PLATFORM FOUNDATION PASS

Phase 6D is ready to be frozen. Phase 6E may begin only after the user reviews and approves this closeout report. Phase 6E has not started.
